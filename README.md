# Auto-Pilot-Demo
This is the project about auto-pilot. Demo base on Lego EV3DEV platform. 

# NOTICE

By 5 Oct, I hopt all the team members can really understand how the hardware(ev3dev) works and be ablt to write a simple program(simple sensor and actuator loop). 

# Introduction
Eventhrough there are some certain reference documentations for the platform EV3dev or Python language, they are always constructed seperately. It means that taking all of those knowledge together for a specific project(Like our project) can be a very difficult thing for a beginner. So to let us better understand how the hardware works, I am going to update some 'Tutorial' here. Follow it and feel free to ask questions.

# What is the LEGO EV3 Controller?
As we all know, Logo EV3 is one of the most powerful hardware controller used to connect those LEGO peripheral electronic devices, which is a thing we can program by its software(Or we can call it IDE) and then download and execute it. Normally whitout any add-on stuffs(Like sd card or usb devices), this controller only works with its own IDE called 'EV3 PROGRAMMER' which is a graphic interface based programming language(like Scrath). GUI programming language usually is designed for kids or young child who are not able to learn coding. Instrad of various key words and syntax, it use some picture(Or we can say it's a Tag) things which can connect with each other following some logical order, just like a puzzle game. And on those pictures, certain feature parameters can be set. When all the tags have been connected, programing is finished. Definitely we have to say this is a very smart and creative way to do programming, but the shortage is it's not flexable and miss the abality to change some more complicate projects. 

# How can LEGO EV3 work with a Unix OS?
Like I mentioned in the previous section, EV3 is not the only controller produced by LEGO. There are indeed some other controllers, for example NXP. But the powerful feature which only appears on EV3 is it can support a Unix OS.
